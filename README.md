# Intelligent Crowd Behavior Evaluation and Evacuation Alert System

**Student:** Ashin Saji  
**Roll No:** 20  
**Course:** 20MCA246 Main Project

---

## Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent system for evaluating crowd behavior patterns and generating evacuation alerts for large public spaces. The system uses zone-based classification, heatmap visualization, and automated alert generation to support safer crowd management.

---

## Features (Planned)

- ✅ Zone-based crowd density analysis
- ✅ 5-level classification system (Safe → Emergency)
- ✅ Interactive heatmap visualization
- ✅ Real-time alert generation
- ✅ Zone-specific evacuation instructions
- ✅ Multiple scenario simulation

---

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Data Processing:** NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **GUI:** PyQt5
- **Alerts:** Pygame
- **Analysis:** SciPy, OpenCV
